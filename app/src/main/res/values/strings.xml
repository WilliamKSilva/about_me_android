        I\'m a Software Developer working most with Web Frontend development and Mobile!
        \n\n\nWith 2 years of work experience in React ecosystem, I feel very
        comfortable to work in more complex projects that are using this kind of stack.
        My focus now is to learn more deeply native android development to improve my projects
        with hybrids techs like React Native and Flutter and maybe start to build some native android
        Apps for fun.
        \n\n\nMy goal in Software Development is to contribute in amazing projects where I can see
        value on what we are building, I\'m passionate about writing code and I hope to follow in this
        area for a long time.
